# My Sneaker Idea Website

This repository shows the web development project I created during my first year of college for the exams. The project spanned the entire academic year and was divided into three sections:

1. **HTML Structure (Part 1):** The initial phase focused on creating the structure of the website using HTML.

2. **Styling (Part 2):** The second part emphasized the visual aspect of the website, where I added styles and aesthetics to enhance the user experience.

3. **Functionality (Part 3):** The final phase concentrated on implementing the necessary functionality to make the website interactive for the user.

This repository serves as a snapshot of my progress in the Web Development module. While the website is not yet ready for deployment, it reflects the skills acquired during this learning journey. I have plans to refine and expand on this project, incorporating additional knowledge and skills gained throughout my academic experience.
